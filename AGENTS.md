# Research Template — Agent Instructions

This is a **reproducible-research project template** that combines:

- **Snakemake** pipeline for data → analysis → report (.tex -> .pdf via latexmk)
- **Conda** environments per pipeline step
- **OpenCode skills** for the LLM-driven research loop (paper-read, lit-search, research-companion, weekly-review, orchestrate)
- **Wiki** as the persistent knowledge base (Obsidian-compatible)
- **Hooks** that auto-track edits, debounce-commit, and emit events
- **Vault-sync** that mirrors notes from the user's primary Obsidian vault

You (the LLM) operate inside this repo. Read this file first, then follow it.

## Critical Conventions

**LLM agents in this repo are forbidden from running `git commit` under any circumstances.**

The user prefers eager invocation — they don't want to type slash commands.

When their message matches a trigger from `.opencode/AGENTS.md`, IMMEDIATELY READ
the relevant `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and follow it. Do NOT paraphrase
the skill. Do NOT delay with clarifying questions before reading — the skill
itself tells you whether to ask.

Quick reference:

| User says or does... | Read this skill |
|---|---|
| Session start, "what should I work on?", "catch me up" | `research-session` |
| Mentions PDF, arXiv URL, "read this paper", "discuss" | `paper-read` |
| "find papers on X", "lit review", "survey" | `lit-search` |
| "brainstorm", "what if", "should I try X?", proposes an idea | `research-companion` |
| "weekly review", "progress check" | `weekly-review` |
| "sync from vault", "pull notes" | `vault-sync` |
| Multi-angle / complex multi-domain task | `orchestrate` |

### Wiki Discipline

When ingesting a paper:

1. **Update an existing topic page** rather than creating a standalone entity page (default).
2. Promote to `wiki/entities/<short-id>.md` only if it warrants a deep-read.
3. Always add `[[wikilinks]]` between new and existing pages — no orphans.
4. Append to `wiki/log.md` and update `wiki/index.md` after every operation.
5. See `wiki/wiki.schema.md` for page-type schemas and length tiers.

### State Discipline

- `research-state.yaml` at repo root — read on session start. The hook updates `last_updated`. You update content fields (`recent_research_evaluations`, `wiki.total_pages`, etc.) as side effects of skill execution.
- `events.jsonl` is **append-only**. Never edit it. Hooks and skills append; nothing rewrites.
- Both files live at the **repo root**, not under `.claude/` or `.opencode/`. This keeps them brand-neutral and visible.

### Vault-Mirror Discipline

`wiki/.vault-mirror/` is a one-way mirror of the user's primary Obsidian vault
(typically `~/Documents/OneDrive/obs-notes/02 - Projects/<project>/`). The mirror
is configured in `research-state.yaml` under `vault_sync:`, populated by
`hooks/vault_sync.sh`, and surfaced by the `vault-sync` skill.

**NEVER edit files inside `wiki/.vault-mirror/`.** Any edits are overwritten on the
next sync. Use it as **input material**: grep it for keywords, cite findings in
wiki pages, surface insights when relevant.

If the user wants content reflected back in their primary vault, they edit the
primary vault directly.

### Fidelity Discipline (no extrapolation)

**All wiki documentation must be a condensation of input, never an extrapolation
from it.** This applies to every page you write or edit — topic pages, entity
pages, syntheses, queries, research evaluations.

Rules:

1. **Cite or omit.** Every claim, finding, or quote on a wiki page must be
   traceable to a specific source: a paper in `wiki/sources/papers/`, a note in
   `wiki/.vault-mirror/`, a chat exchange, or an explicit user statement. If
   you cannot point to the source, do not write the claim.
2. **No filling in gaps.** If `wiki/.vault-mirror/` contains a half-formed note,
   do **not** complete the thought, infer what the user "probably meant", or
   smooth a fragment into a paragraph. Quote or paraphrase only what is there.
   Mark genuine gaps with `TODO: <what's missing>` rather than inventing.
3. **No synthesis without explicit user request.** Do not write "X implies Y"
   or "this generalises to Z" unless the source said so or the user asked for
   synthesis. When the user asks for synthesis, label it: `> [!synthesis]` or a
   "Synthesis (LLM-generated)" heading.
4. **Prefer shorter over longer.** Default to compression. A 200-word topic
   update beats a 1500-word topic update built on speculation. If you find
   yourself padding a section, stop and cut it instead.
5. **Vault-mirror is read-only input, not a prompt.** Notes in
   `wiki/.vault-mirror/` are seeds the user wrote for themselves — they are
   often shorthand, exploratory, or contradictory. Treat them as evidence of
   what the user has thought about, **not** as a license to expand on the
   user's behalf. If a mirrored note contains "consider Balmorel under
   structural change", the wiki may say "user has flagged Balmorel under
   structural change as an open question (`vault-mirror/<path>`)" — it must
   **not** invent what that exploration would conclude.
6. **Distinguish observation from interpretation.** When a section mixes both,
   separate them: facts in plain prose, interpretation under a clearly labelled
   "Interpretation" or "Open questions" subhead.

If you catch yourself writing prose that has no anchor in a source you've read
this session, delete it.

### Cross-Vault Linking

Project notes from the primary vault can link to project-wiki pages and vice
versa using Obsidian's URI scheme:

```
[wiki page from primary vault](obsidian://vault/<repo-folder>/wiki/topics/foo)
[primary-vault note from project](obsidian://vault/obs-notes/02%20-%20Projects/X/note)
```

Or with vault aliases configured: `[[obs-notes/<note>]]` and `[[<repo-name>/<page>]]`.

### Snakemake Discipline

The repo ships with a working demo pipeline (linear-model fit + plot + latexmk
report). To replace with real analyses:

1. Edit `analysis/model.py` and `analysis/vis.py` (or add new scripts).
2. Add corresponding rules in `rules/*.smk` and include them in `Snakefile`.
3. Update `config/default.yaml` with new parameters.
4. Add tests to `tests/test_*.py` and reference them as fixtures in `tests/test_runner.py`.
5. Run `snakemake --use-conda --cores 4` to verify the DAG resolves and produces `build/report.html`, `build/report.pdf`, and `build/test.success`.

The CI workflow at `.github/workflows/reproduction.yaml` re-runs the pipeline
on every push/PR. Keep it green.

### Hook Awareness

`hooks/research_hook.sh` fires on file writes (configured in `opencode.json`).
It:

- Appends events to `events.jsonl` based on the modified file's path
- Updates `last_updated` in `research-state.yaml`

The hook tracks but does **not** commit. Commits are exclusively the user's responsibility — agents never call `git commit`.

### Principles

Two principle files live at `wiki/meta/principles/`:

- **`academic-writing.md`** — 30 prose-quality principles (referenced by paper-read, orchestrate, anything writing-adjacent).
- **`research-strategy.md`** — 8 Carlini-derived strategy principles (referenced by idea-critic, research-strategist, research-companion).

Skills load these by reading the file directly (no plugin needed). When a skill says "see wiki/meta/principles/X.md", actually read it.

## Tone & Style

- Match the user's language — Danish or English, mixed is fine.
- The user is doing PhD-level research (energy systems, sector coupling, Balmorel/Antares modelling). Don't condense into pop-science.
- Honest assessments matter more than encouragement. If a paper is weak, say so. If an idea has scooping risk, name names.
- Inline `Topics:: [[..]]` and `Created:: ...` are Dataview-compatible — keep them as inline fields, don't move to YAML frontmatter (unless explicitly Obsidian frontmatter, like in `wiki/topics/<page>.md` per the schema).

## On Skills That Don't Exist Yet

This template provides 7 skills. If the user asks for something that maps to
one of them, use it. If they ask for something that doesn't (e.g., a writing
review pipeline), say so honestly and offer to do it ad-hoc rather than
fabricating a missing skill.

## When in Doubt

1. Read the relevant skill SKILL.md file.
2. Read the wiki schema (`wiki/wiki.schema.md`).
3. Read the principles (`wiki/meta/principles/research-strategy.md`, `wiki/meta/principles/academic-writing.md`).
4. Ask the user one specific question, not five.
